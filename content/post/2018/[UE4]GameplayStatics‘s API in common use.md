Parameter `WorldContextObject` must be an UObject that can get UWorld, otherwise the following gameplay's functions would not work.

##### The meaning of ProjectWorldToScreen's return value

Even when the Actor is in **LEFT BACK** or **RIGHT BACK** of Camera, `ProjectWorldToScreen` still would return true,  
when Actor is int **RIGHT BEHIND** of Camera, `ProjectWorldToScreen` still would return false.
