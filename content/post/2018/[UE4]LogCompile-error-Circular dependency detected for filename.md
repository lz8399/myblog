Compilation Errorï¼š

    LogCompile : error : Circular dependency detected for filename D:\Library Storage\Documents\Unreal Projects\DistantHome\Source\DistantHome\Public\Game\DHGameInfo.h!
    
Solution:  
Don't include headers in header,  declare class in header and include headers in cpp.

    class forwardedClass;

    class UsingIt
    {
    public:
        forwardedClass* instance;
    }

or
    
    class UsingIt
    {
    public:
        class forwardedClass* instance;
    }
